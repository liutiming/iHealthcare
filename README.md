# iHealthcare

We cannot look after the sick patients 🤒 when the system 🏥 is sick itself.

This documentation will record the isssues that medical professionals, patients, and the general public come across when seeking healthcare. Hopefully, it will serve as a springboard for innovations to come. See the [wiki](https://github.com/liutiming/iHealthcare/wiki) here. 

iHealthcare stands for issues with healthcare.
